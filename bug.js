This error occurs when using the Expo Go app to test your React Native application.  It happens when an asynchronous operation, such as a network request, is not handled properly, leading to unexpected behavior or crashes after the component has unmounted.  The specific error message might vary but will generally indicate that a state update or other operation is being attempted on an unmounted component.  For example, you might see a warning about setting state on an unmounted component or an error related to accessing a null or undefined property.
